# **The Olympics**  
## **Title:** Inclusive Digital Sport for the Next Olympics  

## **1. Introduction**  
This project aims to design and develop an inclusive **digital sport** that anyone athletes, non-athletes, and people with disabilities can play from now until the next Olympics. The sport will be engaging, accessible, and capable of fostering global participation through digital platforms.  

## **2. Problem Statement**  
How might we create a **digital sport** that is:  
- Accessible to **all** users, regardless of skill level or physical ability?  
- **Engaging** enough to keep players returning?  
- **Sustainable** beyond the next Olympics?  
- **Scalable** for global participation?

## **3. Thought Process & Approach**  

### **3.1 Understanding the Problem**  
- The game should be **digital-first**, playable via an app or web platform.  
- Accessibility is key: it should include users with different abilities.  
- It should offer **competitive and casual** gameplay options.  
- The game should encourage **community participation** (e.g., team-based challenges, social interactions).

### **3.2 Ideation Workshop Plan**  
We designed an **ideation workshop** to generate innovative game concepts.  

#### **Workshop Structure:**  
| Step | Activity | Time |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Icebreaker & Context Introduction | 10 min |
| 2 | Idea Generation (Brainstorming, SCAMPER) | 30 min |
| 3 | Idea Selection (Dot Voting / NUF Test) | 20 min |
| 4 | Rapid Sketching | 15 min |
| 5 | Wrap-up & Next Steps | 5 min |  

#### **Key Methods Used:**  
- **Divergent Thinking:** Generating as many ideas as possible using brainstorming techniques.  
- **Convergent Thinking:** Refining the ideas into a feasible concept.  
- **Paper Sketching:** Quick visualization of gameplay mechanics.

### **3.3 Selected Concept & User Flow**  

#### **Final Idea: Virtual Olympic Relay**  
A **global digital relay game** where users complete challenges and pass a virtual baton worldwide.  

#### **User Flow:**  
1. User **creates an account** and joins a global team.  
2. User **selects a challenge** (physical, puzzle, reaction-based).  
3. User **completes the challenge** and earns points.  
4. User **passes the virtual baton** to the next participant.  
5. The system tracks progress, and teams compete in leaderboards.

### **3.4 Prototyping**  
- **Paper Prototyping:**  
  - Sketched 6‚Äì12 core screens to outline gameplay.  
  - Focused on **navigation and interaction clarity**.  

- **Mid-Fidelity Figma Prototype:**  
  - Converted sketches into digital wireframes.  
  - Simulated transitions for **game interactions**.  

---

### **3.5 Animation & Interaction Design**  
- Interactive **baton-passing animation**.  
- Smooth **challenge transitions**.  
- **Leaderboard updates** in real time.  

---

### **3.6 Usability Testing & Iterations**  
- Tested with **5 users** to assess:  
  - **Navigation clarity** (was the game easy to understand?)  
  - **Engagement** (did users enjoy the experience?)  
  - **Accessibility** (could everyone participate easily?)  

#### **Key Learnings from Testing:**  
- Some users struggled with **baton-passing mechanics** ‚Üí Improved onboarding.  
- Players wanted **more challenge variety** ‚Üí Added **custom difficulty levels**.  
- The leaderboard needed **better visibility** ‚Üí Enhanced placement.
