# Seamstress UX Project

## **Project Overview**  
**Client:** Elsa, a seamstress who makes custom swimsuits via Instagram.  
**Challenge:** Elsa struggles with time management due to the manual process of gathering customer requirements and managing production time.  
**Goal:** Design a digital solution to streamline Elsaâ€™s order management process, improve time efficiency, and enhance customer experience.  

## **Project Timeline (October 21-24, 2024)**  
The project follows a **4-day UX design sprint**, integrating user research, ideation, prototyping, and testing to iteratively refine the solution.  

## **Design Process & Deliverables**  

### **1. Empathy (User Research & Understanding Elsa's Needs)**  
**Objective:** Identify Elsaâ€™s pain points and understand user behavior.  
**Methods Used:**  
- User Interview with Elsa  
- Competitive Analysis of online ordering systems  
- Customer Journey Mapping  

**Deliverables:**  
âœ… **User Research Report** â€“ Key insights from Elsaâ€™s workflow  
âœ… **Empathy Map** â€“ Understanding Elsaâ€™s frustrations & goals  
âœ… **User Journey Map** â€“ Current & ideal experience

### **2. Define (Problem Framing & UX Strategy)**  
**Objective:** Clearly define the problem and outline key user needs.  
**Methods Used:**  
- Persona Creation  
- Problem Statement Definition  
- Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD)  

**Deliverables:**  
âœ… **Persona Profile:** Elsaâ€™s key needs & behaviors  
âœ… **Problem Statement:**  
*"Elsa needs a way to manage swimsuit orders efficiently because her current manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors."*

### **4. Prototype (Designing the Solution)**  
**Objective:** Create a prototype for Elsaâ€™s digital order system.  
**Methods Used:**  
- **Paper Prototype (Lo-Fi):** 6 core screens outlining user flow  
- **Wireframes (Mid-Fi):** Figma interactive prototype  

**Deliverables:**  
âœ… **6-Screen Paper Prototype** (order submission, order tracking, time estimates)  
âœ… **Figma Mid-Fidelity Wireframe**  
âœ… **User Flow Diagram** â€“ Step-by-step process  

---

### **5. Testing (Integrated in All Phases)**  
**Objective:** Validate the design and refine based on Elsaâ€™s feedback.  
**Methods Used:**  
- Usability Testing (5 users including Elsa)  
- Task-Based Testing  
- Iteration Recommendations  

**Deliverables:**  
âœ… **Usability Test Plan** â€“ Scope, objectives, and metrics  
âœ… **Test Results & Key Learnings**  
âœ… **Iteration Suggestions:**  
1. Improve order confirmation visibility.  
2. Add a messaging feature for updates.  
3. Simplify the navigation for quicker access.
