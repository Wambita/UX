## Introduction
Hydration is a critical aspect of athletic performance, but athletes often struggle with tracking their water intake accurately. The project **Athlete-Keep-Hydrated** aims to solve this issue by designing a **hydration wristband** that helps users track and prepare their hydration needs before a race.

## Project Process

### 1. Interviews
We conducted interviews with athletes to understand their hydration challenges, behaviors, and pain points.

### 2. Insights & Analytics
From the interviews, we derived key insights and performed research on hydration needs, leading to data-driven design decisions.

### 3. Persona Development
A user persona named **Pierre** was created based on the gathered insights, representing an athlete who struggles with hydration tracking.

### 4. User Journey Mapping
A user journey was mapped to visualize Pierre’s hydration process **without the hydration wristband** to understand the gaps in the current experience.

### 5. Problem Statement
The core problem identified:
_“How might we help Pierre measure and prepare his hydration before a race?”_

### 6. Ideation
- A **brainstorming session** was conducted with three people.
- Multiple solutions were generated and written on sticky notes.
- A **voting session** determined the best solution.
- The best solution was placed on an **ideation board** for refinement.

### 7. Prototype Development
A **storyboard** was created to demonstrate how Pierre would use the hydration wristband, illustrating step-by-step interactions.

## Limitations
- The prototype is a **conceptual design** and has not yet been tested with real users.
- The solution focuses on **pre-race hydration only** and does not cover hydration tracking **during** the race.
- Additional user testing and iteration are required for improved usability.

---

## Lessons Learned
- **User research is key**: Interviews helped in uncovering real user needs.
- **Iterative design improves solutions**: Brainstorming and voting helped refine the best idea.
- **Prototyping enhances clarity**: The storyboard provided a clear visual representation of the user interaction.
