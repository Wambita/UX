# Going on Holidays

## Overview

**Going on Holidays** is a project aimed at enhancing the experience of going on holidays with friends by identifying and alleviating stressful moments associated with travel and leisure. This README provides insights into the UI/UX aspects of the project, outlining our design process, research findings, and user-centered design principles.

## Project Objectives

- **Understand User Needs:** To gather insights about user experiences during holidays and identify pain points.
- **Enhance Comfort:** To design a solution that makes holiday experiences more enjoyable and stress-free.
- **Foster Collaboration:** To involve users in the design process to create a more relevant and effective product.

## User Research

### Interview Guide

An interview guide was created to extract valuable insights from users. The guide included:

- **Objective:** To understand users' habits and the challenges they face during holidays.
- **Hypotheses:** 
  1. Users experience stress due to poor planning.
  2. Communication breakdowns lead to conflicts among friends during trips.
  3. Lack of awareness about each other's preferences causes dissatisfaction.
- **Main Topics:**
  - Planning and preparation
  - Communication with friends
  - Past holiday experiences
- **Sample Questions:**
  - How do you usually plan holidays with friends?
  - What challenges do you face when coordinating with others?
  - Can you share a memorable holiday experience and what made it enjoyable or stressful?

### Interview Process

Conducted **6 user interviews** in various locations (caf√©s, parks) to gather diverse perspectives. Notes were taken during each interview to capture reactions and insights.

### Affinity Diagram & Empathy Map

Post-interview analysis involved creating an affinity diagram to cluster similar ideas and themes, followed by an empathy map to visualize user sentiments, thoughts, and needs. 

## Problem Statement

**How might we** create a more enjoyable holiday planning experience for friends by addressing communication barriers and enhancing collaboration?

## Ideation

Brainstorming sessions led to several innovative ideas to address the identified problems. The team focused on narrowing these ideas down to three main solutions that would enhance the user experience:

1. **Collaborative Planning Tool:** An app feature that allows users to share itineraries and preferences in real time.
2. **Mood Board for Preferences:** A visual tool where users can express their holiday desires and activities.
3. **Automated Reminders:** Notifications for important deadlines (e.g., booking, packing) to ensure no one is left out.

## User Flow

A comprehensive user flow was created to map out the journey of users interacting with the proposed solutions. This flow focuses on ensuring a seamless experience from planning to execution of holiday trips.

## Prototyping

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes

Initial sketches of the user interface were drawn to visualize the layout and key features. These were used for early testing with users to gather feedback.

### Mid-Fidelity Wireframes

The mid-fidelity wireframes were created using Figma, focusing on the core functionalities identified in the user flow. These wireframes were designed in black and white to emphasize structure over style.

## Usability Testing

Prototypes were tested with users to identify usability issues and areas for improvement. Feedback collected during these sessions will guide further iterations of the design.

## Conclusion

The **Going on Holidays** project is dedicated to creating a user-centered design that enhances the holiday experience for friends. By focusing on user research, collaborative ideation, and iterative testing, we aim to develop a solution that alleviates stress and fosters enjoyable experiences.
