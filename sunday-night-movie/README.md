**Project Title:** Sunday Night Movie  – UX Prototype and Usability Testing  
**Author:** Wambita Sheila Fana  
**Version:** Final  

## **1. Project Context**  
**Client:** *Movie 4 All* (a movie theater chain)  
**Objective:** Create a platform that helps users select a movie quickly, avoiding long decision-making times.  
**Your Role:** UX Designer & Researcher (prototyping and testing features)  

## **2. Features & User Flows**  
From the ideation workshops, three main features were identified:  

1. **Mood-Based Filter:** Users select their current mood, and the system recommends relevant movies.  
2. **Three-Movie Recommendation:** The platform suggests three movies based on user preferences.  
3. **Post-Watch Rating System:** After watching, users rate movies to refine future recommendations.  

Each feature was mapped into a **user flow** before creating wireframes.

## **3. Wireframes & Prototype Development**  
- **Tools Used:** Figma  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Low-Fidelity Sketches**: Initial paper wireframes for structure.  
  2. **Mid-Fidelity Wireframes**: Digital wireframes in grayscale to define layout and navigation.  
  3. **High-Fidelity Prototype**: Fully designed, interactive screens with colors, typography, and branding elements.  
  4. **Animated Prototype**: User interactions simulated in Figma.

## **4. Usability Testing**  
- **Testing Approach:**  
  - Conducted **two rounds** of usability tests.  
  - **First Round (V1):** Evaluated navigation, clarity, and feature effectiveness.  
  - **Second Round (V2):** Implemented improvements based on user feedback and re-tested.  
- **Participants:** 5 users per iteration.  
- **Metrics Used:** Task completion rate, error rate, user satisfaction scores, qualitative feedback.  

### **Key Learnings & Adjustments from V1 to V2:**  
| Issue Identified (V1) | Improvement Implemented (V2) |  
|----------------------|--------------------------|  
| Mood filter felt unnecessary to users | Removed in V2, focused on movie recommendations |  
| Users wanted clearer category labels | Improved categorization and visual hierarchy |  
| Some users struggled to find the rating feature | Moved rating feature to post-watch screen for visibility |

## **5. Final Conclusions & Impressions**  
- **User adoption of the three-movie recommendation feature was high.**  
- **Mood-based filtering was removed in V2** based on user feedback.  
- **Post-watch ratings improved recommendations**, but positioning needed optimization.  
- **Navigation and clarity improved significantly from V1 to V2.**  
- **Overall, the usability of the prototype increased in V2**, with higher engagement levels.

## **6. Next Steps & Recommendations**  
- Further refine movie recommendation accuracy using AI-based preferences.  
- Conduct A/B testing on different UI placements for the rating system.  
- Implement accessibility improvements for a more inclusive experience.
