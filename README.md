# Athlete-Keep-Hydrated

## Project Overview
The **Athlete-Keep-Hydrated** project is a UI/UX design case study focused on solving a common issue faced by athletes—managing and preparing hydration levels before a race. Through a human-centered design process, including interviews, persona creation, ideation sessions, and prototyping, we aimed to develop a user-friendly solution that makes hydration tracking intuitive and effortless.

## Project Process

### 1. **Interviews**
The project began with **interviews** conducted with seven participants to gather qualitative data. The focus was on understanding their hydration habits, challenges they face in staying hydrated before and during a race, and how they currently manage hydration.

### 2. **Insights and Analytics**
From the interviews, we gathered key insights into athletes' pain points related to hydration, such as forgetfulness, difficulty gauging water intake, and lack of a simple, real-time solution. These insights were used to inform the next steps of the design process. 

Additionally, research on hydration tracking and race preparation was carried out to provide a broader understanding of the problem, which helped us create data-driven personas and journey maps.

### 3. **Persona Creation**
Based on the insights from the interviews and research, we developed a persona named **Pierre**, who represents the target user. Pierre is an athlete who struggles to monitor his hydration consistently before races. He often forgets to drink water in the right quantities and has no efficient tool to track his hydration during race preparation.

**Persona Details:**
- **Name**: Pierre
- **Age**: 32
- **Occupation**: Consultant
- **Goals**: To complete a full marathon within  the next year


### 4. **User Journey**
The next step was creating a **User Journey Map** for Pierre, showing his actions and emotions throughout the hydration process **without any dedicated hydration tools**. This map highlighted the critical touchpoints where Pierre struggled the most, such as preparing his water intake schedule before a race and ensuring he drank the correct amount during the race. It showed that Pierre needs a solution that is hands-free, easy to monitor, and can remind him when to hydrate without causing distractions.

### 5. **Problem Statement**
From the research, persona, and journey map, we defined the problem statement:
**"How might we help Pierre monitor and imporve his hydration strategy before, during and after the race to optimize his performance and recovery? "**
This statement guided the ideation and solution development phases.

### 6. **Ideation & Brainstorming**
We conducted an **ideation and brainstorming session** with three participants to come up with solutions to the problem statement. The brainstorming was done under various constraints, such as "If Pierre was blind," "If Pierre was forgetful," and "If Pierre was clumsy." This helped us generate creative and diverse solutions to the hydration challenge.

#### Steps in the Ideation Process:
1. **Brainstorming**: Participants generated multiple ideas for how Pierre could track hydration.
2. **Voting**: Each participant voted for the top three most promising ideas.
3. **Ideation Board**: All ideas were organized into an **Ideation Board**, categorized by how easy they would be to implement and how effective they were in solving Pierre’s problem. 

#### Selected Idea:
The solution that stood out was the concept of a **Hydration Wristband**. This wristband would be connected to a mobile app that tracks Pierre's hydration levels and sends real-time feedback to him during his race preparation and race.

### 7. **Prototype: Storyboard**
Finally, we created a **Storyboard** to visualize how Pierre would use the hydration wristband in his daily routine. The storyboard illustrates six key steps in the solution:

1. **Pierre sets his hydration goals**: Pierre enters his race day and sets hydration targets in the app connected to the wristband.
2. **Syncing the wristband**: Pierre puts on the wristband and syncs it with the mobile app to track hydration.
3. **Real-time hydration monitoring**: The wristband monitors Pierre’s hydration levels during his race preparation.
4. **Hydration reminders**: The wristband vibrates when it’s time for Pierre to drink water.
5. **Post-race hydration report**: Pierre reviews his hydration data after the race to see how well he followed his hydration plan.
6. **Personalized hydration tips**: The app provides recommendations to improve hydration habits for future races.

## Limitations
While the design process yielded a promising solution, there were a few limitations:
- **Technological Feasibility**: The wristband concept hinges on the integration of real-time hydration sensors, which, while feasible, would require significant development time and testing.
- **Sample Size**: The interviews were conducted with a small group of athletes, so insights may not fully represent the broader athlete population.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the project, several important insights emerged:
- **User-Centered Design**: Designing with the user in mind ensures the solution addresses real pain points.
- **Diverse Ideation**: Using constraints like “If Pierre was forgetful” forced us to think beyond obvious solutions, leading to more creative ideas.
- **Prototyping for Validation**: Storyboarding helped us visualize Pierre’s interaction with the product and validate the effectiveness of our design early in the process.

## Tools Used
- **Figma**: For creating user journey and ideation board.
- **Canva**: For creating, insights, analytics, persona and problem statement
- **Pen and paper**: For creating storyboard and brainstorming.
